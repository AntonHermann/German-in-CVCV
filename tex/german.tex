\paragraph{Obst}
General \emph{problem} cases seem to be problematic for
\CVCV as well, \ex{Obst} %(\ti{/o:p\o s\o t\o/})
comes to mind here:
The \gls{FEN} can only govern the Nucleus \tr{enclosed} by
\ti{[s]} and \ti{[t]}, the preceding Nucleus can't be governed.

\begin{structure}
  \drawCV{5}
  \wordstart
  \C{\ti{P}}
  \longV{o}
  \C{p}
  \emptyV
  \C{s}
  \emptyV
  \C{t}
  \fen
  \Gov{V1}{V0}
  \NoGov{V4}{V3}
  \Gov{V5}{V4}
\end{structure}

\gls{IG} can't save the day either:
While \ti{[s]} and \ti{[t]} do form a valid context for \gls{IG},
which would then be able to govern the preceding Nucleus,
this fails because \gls{IG} needs licensing support from a following
Nucleus, but the \gls{FEN} in german can just govern, not license.

The only other possibility is to resort to somewhat of a loophole:
\ti{[st]} could be analyzed as a \emph{pseudosuffix}.
In this case, there is a domain boundary between \ti{[p]}
and \ti{[s]}, making \emph{V3} %TODO
domain-final and therefore governed.


\paragraph{Overgeneration}
If \glspl{FEN} do govern, too little restriction seems to be placed on
word-final consonant clusters just by \CVCV itself as any combination of
two consonants can be word-final -- the \gls{FEN} governs
the enclosed empty Nucleus either way:

\ti{*[Sa:kf]}
\begin{structure}
  \drawCV{4}
  \wordstart
  \C{\ti{S}}
  \longV{a}
  \C{k}
  \emptyV
  \C{f}
  \fen
  \Gov{V1}{V0}
  \Gov{V4}{V3}
\end{structure}

Note that \cite{scheer2004} is not entirely clear about this issue:
On the one hand, he states that
\q[p.~580]{scheer2004}{consonant clusters need a license in order to exist.
If they fail to be licensed by a vocalic source, a reaction is expected.}
and this cluster clearly fails to get licensed.

\q[p.~178]{scheer2004}{initial \ctx{*\#RT} clusters are ruled out in typical
Indo-European languages because their putative head R fails to be licensed
to govern by its Nucleus, which is empty.}

On the other hand, there doesn't seem to be a clear rule enforcing this.
All examples given are in regard to branching Onsets and therefore \gls{IG},
where the need of a licensing vowel is made explicit.

Further, the \ctx{*\#RT} example is explained differently later on:
The well-formedness of initial \ctx{\#RT} clusters is determined by the existence
of an initial empty CV-unit:
In languages where this CV-unit is present, the empty Nucleus between the two consonants
has to govern the initial empty Nucleus, which is only possible if there is
an \gls{IG} relation between them -- therefore ruling out \ctx{\#RT} sequences.
If this initial CV-unit is absent, there are no restrictions on the initial consonants.
Both \ctx{\#TR} and \ctx{\#RT} are well-formed as long as the enclosed empty Nucleus
is properly governed by a following contentful Nucleus.
There does not seem to be any reason that this wouldn't apply equally to word-final
consonant clusters. On the contrary, he even states the following:
\q[p.486]{scheer2004}{As everywhere else in the grammar when an empty Nucleus is
silenced by Government, the distribution of the flanking consonants is free.}
