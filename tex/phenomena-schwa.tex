\subsection{Schwa distribution}

Because of the multiple vowels that alternate with zero found in Slavik
languages, \cite{scheer2004} abandons the insertion analysis of earlier
\SGP in favor of a deletion analysis.

Another argument brought forward is that where \SGP only differentiates
between final and alternating empty Nuclei, in \CVCV there are
\q[p.~90]{scheer2004}{four kinds of \enquote{empty} Nuclei:
1) \ctx{T\_R}, 2) \ctx{R\_T}, 3) \ctx{C\_\#}, 4) alternation sites}.
Because only 4) shows vowel-zero alternations and the other types
remain empty in all circumstances, he argues that not all empty
Nuclei could be possible alternation sites:
\q[p.~90]{scheer2004}{If it were true that all empty Nuclei
are alternation sites which are filled in by default, there should be
no empty Nuclei that never appear on the surface.}%
\footnote{This argument doesn't seem logical to me.
  As we will see shortly, alternating vowels only manifest phonetically
  if they fail to be governed. 1) to 3) all have in common
  that their empty Nucleus has to be governed anyway, so it isn't
  clear why those can't be theoretical alternation sites where
  the vowel is never inserted because the Nucleus is always governed.}

Alternating vowels are represented as \enquote{floating melodies} in \CVCV:
Both the melody and the structure (V-slots) are underlyingly present
but alternating vowels are not attached to their Nucleus.
If this Nucleus is governed, the weakening effect of Government
prevents the association of the melody and doesn't surface, otherwise
the melody attaches to the Nucleus and the vowel surfaces.
