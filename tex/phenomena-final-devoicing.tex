\subsection{Final devoicing}

Final devoicing is said to apply in Coda contexts.

Context: word-final vs. internal codas;
"However, the reverse situation where a process would only apply to word-final Codas
and/or their preceding vowels, but leave their internal peers untouched, does not seem to exist."

\textquote[Footnote 340 (p.~637)]{%
  At first sight, of course, final devoicing appears to be a massive counterexample to
  this generalisation. However, the status of this phenomenon is not clear.
  For instance, should it be viewed as a lenition or a fortition?
  In case the latter option is chosen, it stands aside the rest of the Coda phenomenology.
  This possibility may actually be provided for by the theory, see ยง543g.
  In any event, final devoicing has always been an alien in phonology.
  Its status as an UFO is independent of any particular theory.%
