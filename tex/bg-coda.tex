\subsection{Strength of consonants in different positions}

\CVCV distinguishes three different contexts in which consonants appear,
with different predictions regarding their \emph{strength},
i.e. whether lenition or fortition processes are predicted to occur
in those contexts.

Where arboreal theories differentiate Onset and Coda contexts
(plus ambisyllabic/extrasyllabic consonants which belong to both/neither,
respectively), \TODO{}



The Coda context in \CVCV is defined as
\enquote{before a governed empty Nucleus}.

Because a governed empty Nucleus can neither govern nor license,
neither force affects Coda consonants.

Consonants in Codas are ungoverned and unlicensed. \parencite[p.~659]{scheer2004}
