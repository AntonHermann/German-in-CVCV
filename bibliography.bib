  abstract = {This book presents a development of Jean Lowenstamm's idea that phonological constituent structure can be reduced to a strict sequence of non-branching Onsets and non-branching Nuclei. The approach at hand is known as 'CVCV', and emerged from Government Phonology. Since its very beginnings in the early 80s, the central claim of this theory has been that syllable-based generalisations are due to lateral relations among constituents, rather than to the familiar arboreal structure. This book shows that Standard Government Phonology did not go far enough in implementing this idea. CVCV completes the missing steps: structure and causality are fully lateralised. Detailed discussion is offered how basic phonological objects and processes such as Codas, closed syllables, long vowels, geminates, syllabic consonants, vowel-zero alternations, closed syllable shortening, compensatory lengthening, lenition and the like can be represented within the CVCV frame. The first part of the book is called "What is CVCV ?". It presents the properties of the theory. The second part focuses on the reasons why it is worthwhile considering CVCV a valuable and viable approach. The primary goal of the book is not to engage the dialogue with other phonological theories. Rather, it aims at establishing a player in the general game: defining the properties of a theory is always prior to its comparison with other models. In the current OT-dominated phonological scene, then, CVCV appears as a true theory of the 80s insofar as it is representational at core: representations exist and are primitive, rather than arising as accidental results from a heterogeneous set of constraints. The original analyses presented in this book are grounded in the languages that the author is best familiar with, i.e. (Western) Slavic, French, German and some Semitic. Particular attention is paid to diachronic evidence in its relation to the synchronic state of languages.},

  abstract = {This chapter is about how generative theories have conceived and implemented the impact of morpho-syntactic information on phonology. The major division is along the two channels that may be used by morpho-syntactic information to reach phonology: derivational (the phonological cycle in its successive incarnations) and representational. The latter inserts representational objects into the linear string that is submitted to phonological computation: juncture phonemes when the basic units were phonemes, SPE-type diacritics such as \# when segments were relevant, and autosegmental domains (prosodic constituency) in the early 1980s. Since that time, the two channels have been associated with specific theories: Lexical Phonology on the derivational, Prosodic Phonology on the representational side. This division of labour is examined over time (phase theory being a relevant player in this context) and correlated with modularity: while generative theory is modular in kind, there have been repeated modularity-violating implementations of the interface. Alignment in OT is an especially noteworthy recent case in point.},

@article{scheerRightEdgeWords,

  author = {Scheer, Tobias},
  abstract = {The paper tackles an important parametric variation in phonology, the one that distinguishes between those languages where word-final consonants count as codas and accordingly produce effects both on their own body and on preceding vowels, and those where they do not. Four implementations of this parameter are discussed: 1) traditional extrasyllabicity, 2) the parameterized distribution of empty nuclei in internal coda clusters as practised in Standard Government Phonology (SGP), 3) Glyne Piggott's parameterization of Coda Licensing, and 4) the variable lateral actorship of final empty nuclei (FEN) that is proposed in CVCV (or Strict CV). Problems with the SGP analysis are pointed out, and the alternative expression of the parameter in the environment of CVCV is discussed. This leads to a readjustment of the network of lateral relations that define syllable structure in CVCV, i.e. to a revision of the Coda Mirror.},

Within this framework, an epenthesis rule is given, which is then applied to allforms of schwa, even the word-final ones. Assuming a particular version of a lexicon (following the theory of lexical phonology) and distributing the epenthesis rule over all levels in the lexicon, the analysis succeeds in describing all subgroups of schwa occurrence adequately and is argued to be superior to accounts previously proposed. Syllabic sonorants are handled by a postlexical rule of reassociation between sonorants and the syllabic nucleus.},
