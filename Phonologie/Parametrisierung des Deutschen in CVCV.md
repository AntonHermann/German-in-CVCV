### <font color=red>TODO: Parameters 3, 6 & 7</font>
## 1. super-heavy Rhymes allowed vs. ruled out
- in German: allowed
- in CVCV: long vowels are head-final
- see §232
## 2. vowel-zero alternations follow Havlík vs. Lower
- explanation: in a chain of alternating vowels:
	- every other (counting from right edge) ***(Havlík)*** vs.
	- all vowels except the last one ***(Lower)*** are vocalised.
- in German: Havlík
- in CVCV: schwa does govern
- see §468, §485, §490
## 3. Coda effects: Closed Syllable Shortening (CSS) does vs. does not occur in `__C#` + word-final consonants are / are not affected
- classical: word-final extrasyllabicity
	- on -> no CSS, no Coda effects in `__(C)#`
	- off -> CSS, Coda effects in `__(C)#`
- ~~in German: situation unclear~~
	- ~~there are said to be word-final extrasyllabic consonants ("Abt", "brätst", "Smaragd")~~
	- ~~but they behave like normal Coda consonants ("Smaragd" -> `[sma:rakt]`)~~
- in German: no CSS, but Coda effects in `__(C)#`
- in CVCV: **TODO**
	- no CSS, no Coda effects in `__(C)#` -> final empty Nuclei license
	- **CSS, Coda effects in `__(C)#` -> final empty Nuclei do not license**
- see §378, `II.12` (§524)
## 4. word-final heavy clusters supernumerary consonants at the right margin are allowed vs. disallowed
- classical: word-final extrasyllabicity on (allowed) vs. off (disallowed)
- in German: allowed
- in CVCV: final empty Nuclei do govern
- see §378, §540, §603
## 5. word-initial `#RT` clusters supernumerary consonants at the left margin are allowed (presence of `#RT` clusters) vs. disallowed (absence of `#RT` clusters)
- classical: word-initial extrasyllabicity on (allowed) vs. off (disallowed)
- note: R = sonorant, T = obstruent
- in German: only `#sT` allowed (which is a special case either way)
- in CVCV: initial CV present
- see Vol.2, `III.6`
## 6. word-initial consonants are strong vs. weak
- classical: -
- in German: ? **TODO**
- in CVCV:
	- **strong -> initial CV present**
	- weak -> initial CV absent
- see Vol.2, `III.6`
## 7. Codas do vs. do not count for stress assignment
- classical:
	- Moraic theory: they are
		- moraic (Weight by Position, i.e. Codas do count) vs.
		- non-moraic (Codas do not count)
	- Metrical grids:
		- there are (Codas do count) vs.
		- there are no (Codas do not count)
		syllable marking rules that transport rhymal information to higher levels
- in German: ? **TODO**
- in CVCV: governed empty Nuclei are
	- visible (Codas do count) vs.
	- invisible (Codas do not count)
	for stress assignment
- see `II.11` (§501)
